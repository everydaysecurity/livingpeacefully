<h2>Why it is so difficult to prevent IPV?</h2>

* <strong>Intimate relationships</strong> <br>
  IPV generally takes place in romantic and intimate relationships where partners have <strong>physical access</strong> to each other's mobile devices. This makes protecting one's privacy very difficult and exhausting. For instance, Mike and Anna just graduated from college and are in an intimate relationship. While Anna goes to yoga class and leaves her phone with Mike, he installed spy apps on her phone because he doesn't trust her. He now has access to Anna's private information such as live location, text messages, photo gallery, etc. IPV not only happens within intimate relationships but also professional relationships such as colleagues and teammates.

  <strong>Our Takeaway:</string>
  Having others gain physically access to your mobile device always make you vulnerable to IPV no matter how strong or unique your password is. Therefore, keeping possession of your mobile devices <strong>at all times</strong> is the best way to protect your privacy while you're in a intimate relationship.

* <strong>Inequality in resources <strong> <br>
  It may in fact never be possible to fully defend against protential abusers, especially when they are typically have more resources and target lower resource victims. Even after identify the attack, the victom still has less resource to defend themselves. victims with lower social and economic status may find security services is hard to access, including lack of education in technology may lead to ignorance of the potential threat.

* Professionals have little experience of it <br>
  The caseworkers, lawyers, police, and other professionals that work with victims report currently having the insufficient technology expertise to help victims with digital threats. Especially for individuals, hiring the experts to investigatr for valid evidence may cost thousands of dollars without guaranteed to be solid enough for conviction.

* Spy application are easy to get and difficult to uninstall.<br>
  There is much software that exists on the internet just by searching in the Apple store or Google Play. The store even directly or undirectly advertised about it. Even if they didn’t, the user can still learn about the app from the comments. The customer services of the app may even teach you how to use it.<br>
  After installing the app, it is very hard to get rid of them. Most of the spy apps will hide without any icon, which is very hard for the victim to say if they are being watched. For instance, the Android system doesn’t show which application is using the GPS service, so even the user notices the unusual services, possibly they would ignore it.<br>
  These applications usually aren’t detected by existing anti-virus and anti-spyware tools. For the spy apps, since some, the application doesn't actually compromise the device themselves. The protecting tools won’t be able to identify them by their behaviors. Second, those apps that are developed for security usage are protected by these tools, which means the misuse will be tolerant.
