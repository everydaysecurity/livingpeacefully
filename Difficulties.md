<h2>Why it is so difficult to prevent IPV?</h2>

* Hard to prevent it during intimate relationship <br>
  Since IPV generally means the attack from a closed person, who probably will have the physical access to the victim's device, most of the security technic will be less useful. For example, couples may share their phones, which allows them to install the spy app in the device. Furthemore, the device lock like fingerprint protection can be easiy cracked when the victim is sleeping. The IPV is not only limited to romatic relationships, the colleagues may also has the chance to access the device during work while the victim is not pay attention to their devices.

* Inequal in resource <br>
  It may in fact never be possible to fully defend against protential abusers, especially when they are typically have more resources and target lower resource victims. Even after identify the attack, the victom still has less resource to defend themselves. victims with lower social and economic status may find security services is hard to access, including lack of education in technology may lead to ignorance of the potential threat.

* Professionals have little experience of it <br>
  The caseworkers, lawyers, police, and other professionals that work with victims report currently having the insufficient technology expertise to help victims with digital threats. Especially for individuals, hiring the experts to investigatr for valid evidence may cost thousands of dollars without guaranteed to be solid enough for conviction.
 
* Spy application are easy to get and difficult to uninstall.<br>
  There is much software that exists on the internet just by searching in the Apple store or Google Play. The store even directly or undirectly advertised about it. Even if they didn’t, the user can still learn about the app from the comments. The customer services of the app may even teach you how to use it.<br>
  After installing the app, it is very hard to get rid of them. Most of the spy apps will hide without any icon, which is very hard for the victim to say if they are being watched. For instance, the Android system doesn’t show which application is using the GPS service, so even the user notices the unusual services, possibly they would ignore it.<br>
  These applications usually aren’t detected by existing anti-virus and anti-spyware tools. For the spy apps, since some, the application doesn't actually compromise the device themselves. The protecting tools won’t be able to identify them by their behaviors. Second, those apps that are developed for security usage are protected by these tools, which means the misuse will be tolerant.
