<h2>Why it is so difficult to prevent IPV?</h2>

* <strong>Intimate relationships</strong> <br>
  IPV generally takes place in romantic and intimate relationships where partners have <strong>physical access</strong> to each other's mobile devices. This makes protecting one's privacy very difficult and exhausting. For instance, Mike and Anna just graduated from college and are in an intimate relationship. While Anna goes to yoga class and leaves her phone with Mike, he installed spy apps on her phone because he doesn't trust her. He now has access to Anna's private information such as live location, text messages, photo gallery, etc. IPV not only happens within intimate relationships but also professional relationships such as colleagues and teammates.


* <strong>Inequality in resources <strong> <br>
  It may in even harder to fully defend against potential abusers who has a high social profile. Victims with lower social or economic profiles may find security services difficult to access.

* Professionals' lack of technology experience <br>
  Some professionals including caseworkers, lawyers, or police does not have the technology expertise to best help the victim with their digital threats. And sometimes, hiring experts to investigate their IPV case may cost thousands of dollars without guaranteed conviction of the abuser.  

* Spyware's ability to be hidden and easily installed <br>
  You can find a variety of spyware on the internet just by searching. And after installing the app, it can be very hard to get rid of them mainly due to their ability to hide from the human eye. Most of the spyware doesn't have an icon, which is very hard for the victim to identify. In addition, these applications usually can't be detected by anti-virus and anti-spyware softwares, therefore doesn't get any attention from the user.
