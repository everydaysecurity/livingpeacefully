<h2>What should we do to prevent IPV?</h2>

To prevent IPV, <strong>improving the level of security of devices</strong> is essential.<br>

•	Set up a password for your device that only you know. <br>
Avoid birth dates (0120, if your birthday is January 20th)<br>
simple series of number(1234, 4321)<br>
repetitions. (0000, 1111)<br>

•	Log out of accounts and apps so that if others do gain access to the device, they can't get the content in the apps.<br>

•	Be aware of who has access to your device and watch out for any unfamiliar application in your phone that you didn't install.<br>

•	Protect the device with antivirus/antimalware software, althuogh they aren’t aiming for spy apps, they still doing a great job for about half of the malicious apps.<br>

•	Constantly check your device about settings and applications, especially for those require location, read/write, and sending message authority. <br>

<br>
When there is malicious post in social media, contect with the developer to save the evidence, contact with the company need to be fast since the data will be deleted within days.

<br>
When there is likely a private information leak, report the abuse to the developer even if the information is not yours. Many online sites have policies against these actions and they will delete it.
