<strong>What is Intimate Partner Violence(IPV)?</strong><br>
Intimate partner violence is a type of violence involving current or former intimate partners. This type of violence has shifted its definition from physical abuse and stalking to exploiting technology in order to track, harass, and intimidate one's intimate partner.<br>

<strong>Why we need to pay attention?</strong><br>
- First, cyber violence can be extremely harmful. It has caused not only mental illnesses but also an increase in the number of teenage self-harm attempts (Swansea University 2018.)

- Second, cyber violence is easily abusable since it can be conducted from a variety of devices such as computers, cellphones, and basically anything that has access to the internet.

- Third, due to the transparency and publicity nature of the internet, leaked private information can be <strong>long-lasting</strong> and <strong>impossible</strong> to remove from the web. For example, some private picture leaked on Facebook may never disappear on the internet. Furthermore, it can leave a  life-lasting trauma to the victim.

- Fourth, when private information leaks, the abuser may harass not only the victim but also the victim's family members, closed friends, etc, which could cause a catastrophe on the social life of the victim.

- Fifth, sometimes it takes authorities a relatively long time after the abuse begins. And since there are only few IPV experts within local authorities, it can be a lengthy process to find and charge the abuser.

- All of these lead to the last reason: many abusers believe that they can get away with internet stalking because it usually takes a long period of time to be proved guilty. Unfortunately, there is true. Too often, we hear from victims whose harassment case wasn't investigated since local authorities don't know what to do or what laws are being broken. (Anderson, 2016) <br>
