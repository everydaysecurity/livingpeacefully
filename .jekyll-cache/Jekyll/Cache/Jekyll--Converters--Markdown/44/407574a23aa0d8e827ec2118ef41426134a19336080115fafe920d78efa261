<h2>Which types of apps are used for intimate partner violence (IPV)?</h2>

<p>While some applications are malicious, others are designed to make our life easier by sharing the location with our loved ones.<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Spy applications</strong></li>
  <li>Designed to track the user and expose their private information to others without them noticing.</li>
  <li>Can be purchased online and installed on target’s mobile phone</li>
  <li>
    <p>Some can also gain access to one’s text messages, browser history, and photo gallery.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Location tracking applications</strong></li>
  <li>Designed with the intention of keeping family members &amp; friends closer by sharing location with each other.</li>
  <li>Exp: <em>Life360</em>, <em>iMapp</em>, <em>Glympse</em></li>
  <li>On Life360’s website, it stated that their mission was to “…bring your family closer with smart features designed to protect and connect the people who matter most.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Location apps like Life360 can act like a <em>double-edged sword</em>, however. While it is great at keeping families close, it is also commonly used for stalking due to its ability to track live location.</p>

<p>Additionally, popular systems like IOS and Android has the function to disable certain app uninstallation, which makes location tracking apps a very good substitute when an abuser does not want to pay for a “spyware.”</p>
