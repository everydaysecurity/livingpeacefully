<h2>Where On My Device Can I Check If I Have Spyware?</h2>

Spyware apps can be undetectable on your phone, the app can not be shown on your screen. However, you can still check if these apps are downloaded through your purchase history<br>

<strong>Apple</strong>


- Open the “App Store”
- Click on your profile
- Click on “Purchased”
- You can then search for specific apps in the search bar. You can even search keywords such as “spy” and “track”

<strong>Android</strong>

- OPTION 1:
	- Go to “Settings”
	- Click on “Apps”
	- Click on the three vertical dots on the top right
	- Click “show system apps” to view all the applications on your phone
	- This is where you can see if there are any apps you don’t recognize
- OPTION 2:
	- Go to “My Files”
	- Click on “Downloads”
	- Go through your files and see if there is anything you don’t recognize

Additionally, there are tell-tale signs that show that there is spyware on your device:
