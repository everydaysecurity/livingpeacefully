<h2>What is Nonconsensual pornography or revenge porn?</h2>
As previously mentioned, one kind of harass of IPV is to leak private information online, which is an example of Nonconsensual pornography. It involves uploading online nude or semi-nude images or videos without the owner's consent. When the action is based on hate or revenge for break up, it is called revenge porn.

Generally, when this kind of action happened during IPV, it is a sign that the abuser tries to ruin the private life of the victim. As a result, more private information, like the contact information, even the information from the friends or family of the victim may facing the leak.

<h2>How serious is it?</h2>
In 2014, an anonymous user posted a large archive of nude or partially-clad images of female celebrities to the image-sharing website 4Chan. The pictures were mostly selfies of some of the most famous women in the world, including Jennifer Lawrence. 

- These picture sadly would never dissappear online, and means to public shame and humiliation the victim.

- The other anonymous user may follow the abuser to harass the victim. The victim may have to delete their account for a fresh start.

- Survivors were less likely to report to the police when the perpetrator was someone they knew due to shame, embarrassment, which are similar to the sexual assault  victims.

- The victim could go through trust issues, PTSD, anxiety, depression, loss of control, and how revenge porn affected their self-esteem.

- The police officor may not treat the harass as the same as sexual assult, even though the revenge porn is as serious as the it.

<h2>However, it is still a crime</h2>

Currently, there are <strong>28</strong> U.S. states with legislation regarding nonconsensual pornography, which means, it is still a crime and can be convicted up to 3 years' sentence.

- Contact to the website, for social media site, the revenge porn is also not their wishes, so they will help you to remove most of it and local the original poster if your lawyer requires it.

- Make sure to save the evidence of the orginal post, especially if it could only come from someone you know.

- Check if there are other IPV behavior is going on.

- Sadly, clean the accout for a fresh start.
